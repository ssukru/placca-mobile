# placca-mobile

you can comment drivers by their vehicle's plate on 'placca'. there is a lot of possibility to make project even better; adding new features (liking comments, editing profile, rating plate etc.), improving ui/performance, make code more clear.. but I don't wanna stuck on this project. that's my first project that I've done and it doesn't have to be perfect. to keep my energy up, I'll continue my journey with new ideas and projects. here are some screenshots of app:

-welcome screen

-profile screen. you can use app anonymously and do everything as normal user but you can't see your previous comments and edit your profile. for to do that, you have to create an account. if you'd like you can attach previous comments to your new profile (comments that you posted anoynmously).

-if you tick that option then we'll be attaching your previous comments to new account.

-add comment screen

-home screen. you can search plates from search bar at the top of the screen. and there you can see recent comments from all users. anonymous comments are nameless so I name them as "Anonim", such a genius approach.

-sign in/sign up screens (as you can see, there is no option for linking previous comments to new account when you create fresh new account.)
